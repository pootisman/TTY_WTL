\section{Review of the Team 6 report: \\ Characteristic impedance of strip transmission line.}
Your report clearly shows how the model was calculated, what theoreical background was used. However, there are some small errors related to grammar, but they can be dropped here. However, for some really serious publication, I would run the spell checker a few times. This is of course if You have time to edit the text a few times. The research part was done very good, a clear picture of model was given, various operation modes have been shown. Figures in the report are also done pretty well, they take a reasonable amount of space on the page and are informative enough. All in all, the report is done very well, there is not much to be fixed, if anything at all.
