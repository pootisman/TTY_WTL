\section{Review of the Team 4 report: \\ Simulation and Analysis of Finned Waveguides.}
\subsection{Minor issues.}
On the second page of Your report the image of the cross-section is doubled, as I understand it's done for comprehension of the model. However, as a small suggestion, there are plenty of image editors that could have helped You out with that. Anyway, it's not critical. Another thing I noticed was the amount of simulation points for the cutoff frequency. I can understand that COMSOL eats up a lot of system resources, but it would be better if the plot contained more points. Still, it's not critical also, the behaviour of the function can be noticed using the plot.
\subsection{What was good.}
You described what did You do in order to improve simulation results, how the values behaved depending on the parameters. It was also mentioned when certain parameters are important for us.
\subsection{Summary.}
In total I can say that the report is pretty well done, abstract clearly states what will be presented in paper. However, there are some small issues with pictures, but nothing really critical.
